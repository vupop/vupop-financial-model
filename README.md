# Vupop Interactive Financial Model

This project is an interactive financial dashboard designed for investors to model and visualize Vupop's potential exit scenarios. It combines a clean, modern user interface with a powerful financial modeling engine, all built to run seamlessly on GitHub Pages.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Interactive Dashboard UI
- A dynamic and responsive dashboard inspired by modern analytics platforms.
- The UI will include:
    - Main navigation
    - Data filters
    - Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards
    - Interactive charts and graphs
    - Detailed data tables

### 2. Financial Modeling Engine
- The core financial logic, derived from the provided spreadsheet, will be implemented in JavaScript.
- Investors will be able to adjust key assumptions (e.g., user growth, monetization rates) to see the impact on the valuation.

### 3. Dynamic Real-time Updates
- All components of the dashboard—KPIs, charts, and tables—will update instantly in response to changes in the financial model's assumptions.

### 4. Secure Access
- The application will be protected by a client-side password prompt.
- The dashboard and its data will only be accessible after successful authentication.

### 5. Modern Technology Stack
- The project will follow a modular and maintainable structure:
    - **`index.html`**: The main entry point for the application.
    - **`css/style.css`**: For all styling and presentation.
    - **`js/`**: A directory for modular JavaScript files, separating concerns like state management, UI manipulation, and financial calculations.

### 6. GitHub Pages Deployment
- The entire application will be built as a static website, ensuring it can be easily deployed and hosted on GitHub Pages.
